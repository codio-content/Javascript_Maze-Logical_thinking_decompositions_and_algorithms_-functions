|||definition
A variable is named placeholder for a value and that value can change over time.
|||

Here are some examples of variable names and show values being assigned to them.

- width = 40
- height = 30
- numberOfMonsters = 4
- X = 5
- Y = 12

These values can be changed at any time. 

Other parts of your program can inspect what value a variable contains and then use that value to do something.

## Maze width and height example
If we use a variable `width = 16` and `height = 15` then we call `createEmptyMaze()`, the game could be set to look at `width` and `height` and set the size based on those varaible values.
