On the left side is some code that show a few more tips and tricks with loops.

## Counter variable names
Programmers often use `i` and `ctr` as variable names for a counter. `i` is used as an abbreviation for 'index', which will make sense later on when we introduce arrays.

We will use `i` for loop counters to get you used to this common practice.

## More than one statement
Look at the second loop on the left. Here you can see how we can actually include more than one statement in a) the initialisation part and b) the end of loop part.

The statements will execute in the order they appear, separated by commas.

Notice how we decided to move the `addMonster()` instruction into the `for` loop 3rd section rather than having it within the loop code block (which would also have worked).
