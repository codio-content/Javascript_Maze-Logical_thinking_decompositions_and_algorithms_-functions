## Advice : Copy and paste
It is annoying having to write out all your code from scratch when you have some similar code you can copy, paste and then edit. 

1. Highlight the lines of code for the loop that is already there.
1. The best way to copy highlighted code is using a keyboard shortcut. This is `ctrl+c` on a PC or `cmd+c` on a Mac.
1. You can also right click on the highlighted code and use the copy from there, but we recommend you use the keyboard as it is faster.
1. To paste your copied code, click in the code at the position you want to the copied code to go, the press `ctrl+v` on a PC or `cmd+v` on a Mac to paste it in.
1. Now edit the copied code.
