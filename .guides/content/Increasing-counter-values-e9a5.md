One of the things you will do a lot (and have already done in fact) is to increase the counters as you loop.

Javascript and most other languages provide shorthand ways of doing this as it is such a common requirement.

## i++ and ctr++
This is a really useful shorthand way of writing `i = i + 1` or `ctr = ctr + 1`. Adding one to a counter is so common that most programming languages provide something like this. There are actually 2 operators available to you

- `variable++` increments (increases the value of `variable` by 1)
- `variable--` decrements (decreases the value of `variable` by 1)

## ctr += 10
The `+=` operator adds 10 to the `ctr` variable, so it is the same as writing `ctr = ctr + 10`.

The reason for this is that it makes the code a little shorter and easier to read.
